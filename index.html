        <p id="p2">Arts and crafts describes a wide variety of activities involving making things with one's own hands.
            Arts and crafts is usually a hobby. Some crafts (art skills) have been practised for centuries, others are
            more recent inventions. William Morris, John Ruskin and others promoted an "arts and crafts" movement in the
            late 19th century, which popularized the phrase</p>
        <p id="p3">Both children and adults enjoy arts and crafts. Children in schools may learn skills such as
            woodworking, wood carving, sewing, or making things with all sorts of material. Many community centres and
            schools have evening or day classes and workshops where one can learn arts and craft skills.</p>

            <h3>Making car-Making a cardboard car is a fun activity. A large cardboard car, made from a moving box, can
                keep a toddler or small child entertained for hours. A small toy car is equally fun. To make either a
                large or a small cardboard car, youâ€™ll need a pencil, box cutter, and some glue.</h3>

                <h3>Inspiration (from the Latin inspirare, meaning "to breathe into") is an unconscious burst of creativity in a literary, musical, or visual art and other artistic endeavours. The concept has origins in both Hellenism and Hebraism. The Greeks believed that inspiration or " enthusiasm " came from the muses, as well as the gods Apollo and Dionysus.</h3>
